# max_attempt

Max's attempt at our fortune (cookie) teller idea with tarot cards and GPT.

*Note that if you want to run it on your machine with the GPT API you will have to get and add your own API key.*
Do this by making an account on OpenAI and copying your token into a `.env` file in the root directory in this format: `API_KEY=your_api_key`. Make sure that you do not push your `.env` file to the repo as this will jeopardize your key, but this should already be in place with the `.gitignore`.
